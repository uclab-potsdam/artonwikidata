## Time

[](vis/#inception&col=%23FF00D3&yax=0;40000&xax=0;2020&line=&ann=&high=)
When were these paintings made?

The vast majority date from the last 600 years. While scattered entries appear before 1400, the data begins a steady ascent from the 15th century onward.


[](vis/#inception&col=%23FF00D3&yax=0;40000&xax=1400;2010&line=&ann=&high=)
Zooming in on this timeframe, three periods of accelerated growth emerge:


[](vis/#inception&col=%23FF00D3&yax=0;40000&xax=1400;2010&line=1420;0;1600;0;0;0;0;0&ann=1506.15%3B0%3B6321.9%3B0%3BRenaissance&high=)
The first rise around 1500 coincides with the **Renaissance**, an era of increased artistic production and systematic documentation across Europe.


[](vis/#inception&col=%23FF00D3&yax=0;40000&xax=1400;2010&line=1600;0;1750;0;0;0;0;0&ann=1506.15%3B0%3B6321.9%3B0%3BRenaissance%7C%7C%7C1662.6%3B0%3B21025.2%3B0%3BBaroque&high=)
A second, sharper spurt occurs in the mid-17th century, aligning with the rise of **Baroque**. 
This was an era when art transitioned from exclusive church and aristocratic commissions to an open market, effectively turning art into a commodity.


[](vis/#inception&col=%23FF00D3&yax=0;40000&xax=1400;2010&line=1860;0;1970;0;0;0;0;0&ann=1506.15%3B0%3B6321.9%3B0%3BRenaissance%7C%7C%7C1662.6%3B0%3B21025.2%3B0%3BBaroque%7C%7C%7C1917.65%3B0%3B37092.6%3B0%3BModern%20Art&high=)
Thirdly, the data shows a considerable explosion of art during the 19th century, reflecting the emergence of **Modern Art**, followed by another spike in the 1960s, a period marked by a range of cultural transformations around the world.



## Material

[](vis/#materials)
What are paintings made of? 

The property "made from material" (P186) refers to the type of paint used and the surface to which it is applied.


[](vis/#materials&col=%23FF00D3&xax=0;600000&line=474599.52;0;583726.5;0;Wood;0;Canvas;0.1&ann=451828.8%3B0%3BWood%3B0.8%3B590%2C990&high=590990;Oil%20Paint)
**Oil paint** dominates the materials used for painting with over 50% usage. This reflects institutional bias as much as artistic preference. Oil on canvas was the standard of European academies for centuries, and those collections have been most actively digitized.


[](vv/#filter=Material,Material%3AOil+paint&ids=Q3649209,Q59399118,Q23926250,Q26972878)
In the sample, the prevalence of oil is even more pronounced.


[](vv/#filter=Material,Material%3APanel&ids=Q15592269,Q63871946,Q2155289,Q5554756)
Before canvas became dominant, wooden **panel** was the standard support, especially around 1500, when its smooth surface allowed for precise, detailed application of paint.


[](vv/#ids=Q3814939,Q3862683,Q3220280,Q3877893&borders=Q220859)
Jan van Eyck's *Arnolfini Portrait* (1434) shows what oil on panel could achieve. 


[](vv/#ids=Q220859)
The painting depicts a merchant and his wife in their home. Van Eyck applied thin glazes to create depth and luminosity: the brass chandelier glows, the convex mirror reflects the room, the green dress shimmers.


[](vv/#ids=Q549847,Q1170194,Q2416277,Q128910&borders=Q321303)
Hieronymus Bosch's *The Garden of Earthly Delights* (ca. 1490–1500) demonstrates another advantage of panel…


[](vv/#ids=Q321303)
The structural support needed for large triptychs designed to open and close. The three panels depict paradise, earthly pleasures, and hell, a moral arc from creation to damnation.


[](vv/#ids=Q2273452,Q32234,Q661378,Q275349&borders=Q219831)
Rembrandt's *Night Watch* (1642) shows why canvas eventually prevailed.


[](vv/#ids=Q219831)
At this scale (363 × 437 cm), canvas was lighter and more practical. Its woven texture also enabled the thick impasto brushwork that gives the painting its dramatic lighting.






## Genres

[](vis/#genre)
What do paintings depict?

Genres classify paintings by subject matter. These categories reflect not just what is shown in the painting, but the conventions of artists and the expectations of audiences.



[](vis/#genre&col=%23ff00d3&xax=0;140000&line=&ann=127014.89%3B0%3BReligious%20Art%3B0.8%3B139%2C598&high=139598;Portrait)

The prevalence of portraits reflects centuries of private patronage.


[](vv/#search=PORTRAIT&ids=Q3605518,Q16685337,Q7125093,Q4063783)
Those who could afford to commission art often sought to preserve their own likeness or that of their kin.

First, of course, *Mona Lisa* (ca. 1503–1506) by Leonardo da Vinci.


[](vv/#ids=Q12418&search=PORTRAIT)
It remains the most recognized portrait in Western art, depicting Lisa Gherardini, wife of a Florentine merchant. Its sfumato technique and enigmatic expression influenced the genre for centuries.

By the late 18th century, portraits grew more casual and intimate.


[](vv/#ids=Q19273424&search=PORTRAIT)
Élisabeth Louise Vigée Le Brun's 
*Self-Portrait with Her Daughter, Julie* (1789) captures affection through an informal, dynamic composition.


[](vv/#search=PORTRAIT&ids=Q829572,Q613390,Q3399454,Q126467&borders=Q12418,Q19273424,Q2899286)
Another hundred years later, we see a greater variety of poses and styles. 


[](vv/#ids=Q2899286&search=PORTRAIT)
Édouard Manet's *Berthe Morisot with a Bouquet of Violets* (1872) departs further from tradition. Loose brushwork captures mood and personality rather than detailed likeness.




[](vis/#genre_timeline_religious&col=%23FF00D3&yax=0;5494.5&xax=1201.5;2000&line=&ann=1498.37%3B0%3B4237.1%3B0%3BReligious%20Art&high=)
**Religious art** ranks second, though its temporal distribution differs from portraiture.


[](vv/#filter=Genre,Genre%3AReligious+art&ids=Q11521063,Q11622009,Q4535082,Q4731387)
These works cluster between 1400 and 1680, when the church remained the dominant patron in Europe. Altarpieces, devotional panels, and biblical narratives filled churches and private chapels.


[](vv/#filter=Genre,Genre%3AReligious+art&ids=Q4197625,Q3910904,Q17167087,Q3937663)
A smaller, distinct spike appears at the turn of the 13th century, marking the transition from Byzantine traditions to the Proto-Renaissance. 


[](vv/#filter=Genre,Genre%3AReligious+art&ids=Q3964097,Q3937289,Q3608002,Q3975688&borders=Q2016193)
During this period, artists began introducing spatial depth into sacred subjects.


[](vv/#filter=Genre,Genre%3AReligious+art&ids=Q2016193)
Giotto's *Madonna Enthroned* (ca. 1310) is a key work from this period. Unlike the flat icons that preceded it, the panel suggests a three-dimensional space.


[](vv/#filter=Genre,Genre%3AReligious+art&ids=Q3983794,Q3910904,Q3705918,Q3877893&borders=Q734834)
Two centuries later, we notice ever more elaborate paintings to furnish the interior of churches. 
In particular altarpieces and devotional panels were commissioned to inspire faith and make scripture visible to those who could not read.


[](vv/#filter=Genre,Genre%3AReligious+art&ids=Q734834)
The *Ghent Altarpiece* (1432) by Jan and Hubert van Eyck is a massive polyptych with twelve panels depicting the Adoration of the Lamb. It served as both a liturgical centerpiece and a showcase of the newly perfected oil technique.


[](vv/#filter=Genre,Genre%3AReligious+art&ids=Q2680589,Q3933572,Q567861,Q109311797&borders=Q1213151)
By 1600, the Catholic Church sought a new visual language to counter the Protestant Reformation. Religious art became more theatrical to stir emotion and reaffirm faith.


[](vv/#filter=Genre,Genre%3AReligious+art&ids=Q1213151)
Caravaggio's *The Entombment of Christ* (1603) marks this shift in religious painting. Still a church commission, it moves from multi-panel Renaissance altarpieces toward a single canvas with dramatic lighting and expressive faces.




[](vis/#genre_timeline_landscape&col=%23FF00D3&yax=0;5494.5&xax=1201.5;2000&line=&ann=1686.35%3B0%3B4185.1%3B0%3BLandscape%20Painting&high=)
Occupying third position among the top genres, **landscape painting** rose to wider prominence later than portraits or religious art.



[](vv/#filter=Genre,Genre%3ALandscape+painting&ids=Q977200,Q106509908,Q6803438,Q5326908)

[](vv/#filter=Artist,Artist%3AJ.+M.+W.+Turner&ids=Q28539779)
Turner's *Norham Castle, Sunrise* (ca. 1845) depicts a medieval ruin in faint outlines within washes of golden light. Its emphasis on atmosphere over detail anticipated Impressionism by several decades.


[](vv/#filter=Genre,Genre%3ALandscape+painting&ids=Q328523)
Claude Monet's *Impression, Sunrise* (1872) gave Impressionism its name, depicting the harbor of Le Havre in hazy morning light. It marks a turn toward conveying atmosphere rather than accuracy.

Vincent van Gogh's *The Starry Night* (1889) transforms a view from his asylum window into swirling energy. The painting shifts landscape from observation to emotional expression.



## Movements

[](vis/#movements&col=%23FF00D3&xax=0;140000&line=&ann=&high=)
How can we place paintings in their historical context?

Art movements categorize art into periods that share themes, techniques, and time. 
Here, we will consider the six most prevalent movements.



[](vis/#movements&col=%23FF00D3&xax=0;35193.5&line=&ann=&high=29261;Baroque)
Baroque tops the list.

**Symbolism** emerged at the end of the 19th century as a reaction against Realism and Impressionism's focus on the visible world. Symbolist painters sought to express inner states, dreams, and spiritual mysteries through evocative imagery.



[](vv/#filter=Movement,Movement%3ASymbolism&ids=Q2889789,Q3203218,Q1393851,Q28447020)

**Expressionism** emerged in early 20th-century Germany as a subjective response to modern life.

Wikidata also links Post-Impressionist precursors like Munch and Van Gogh with the movement, which is why Expressionist works in this dataset begin appearing already in the late 19th century.


[](vv/#filter=Movement,Movement%3AExpressionism&ids=Q7125093,Q20194344,Q7400771,Q650526)
Where Impressionists captured outward appearances, Expressionists turned inward. By distorting form and color, they sought to externalize emotional states.

*The Scream* (1893) has become an icon of modern anxiety: a figure on a bridge, hands raised to the face, beneath a red and orange sky. Munch described it as "the infinite scream passing through nature."

Many more movements could be discussed. We now turn from the eras of art to the people behind the paintings.


## Painters

[](vis/#gender)
Among the over 70,000 artists associated with paintings on Wikidata, the vast majority, nearly 60,000, are identified as male. Female artists account for just over 11,000. 

Non-binary and gender-diverse identities are nearly invisible: just 19 artists. This tiny sliver reflects historical erasure, the limitations of binary categories in art documentation, and likely also the recency of non-binary recognition in institutional records.



[](vis/#gender_timeline&col=%23FF00D3&yax=0;50&xax=1500;2000&line=1989.59;0;1975.75;0;46.8;0;45.1;0,1989.59;0;1989.59;0;44.3;0;46.6;0&ann=&high=)
However, the ratio of women among documented painters has risen steadily: from around 1.5% in the 1500s to over 40% for those born in recent decades. Each century roughly doubled the share of the previous one. 

Although the Old Masters were predominantly male, as their name suggests, the data indicates that barriers to entry and recognition have gradually decreased.




[](vis/#continent)
The geographic distribution of artists tells its own story.
Painters on Wikidata come almost exclusively from Europe and North America.

The rest of the world, which is home to more than 80% of the world's population, is dramatically underrepresented.


[](vis/#geo_timeline&col=%23FF00D3&yax=0;20&xax=1500;2000&line=1953.88;0;1969.41;0;18.9;0;19.6;0,1970.56;0;1969.41;0;18.6;0;19.6;0&ann=&high=)
A similar but slower shift appears in geographic origins. Like women, painters from outside Europe and North America were long underrepresented, below 5% until the mid-19th century. The ratio rises through the 20th century, reaching nearly 20% for those born in the 1970s. But unlike gender, which approaches 40% in recent decades, geographic diversity remains limited.


[](vis/#productivity&col=%23FF00D3&yax=0;4500&xax=20;105.1&line=&ann=65.82%3B0%3B2207.2%3B0%3BRubens%7C%7C%7C91.66%3B0%3B1974.7%3B0%3BPicasso%7C%7C%7C83.67%3B0%3B3290.5%3B0%3BBose%7C%7C%7C76.08%3B0%3B3826.1%3B0%3BTurner%7C%7C%7C37.53%3B0%3B1122.7%3B0%3Bvan%20Gogh%7C%7C%7C39.57%3B0%3B2047.2%3B0%3BPalsa%7C%7C%7C52.3%3B0%3B2322.7%3B0%3BWitkacy%7C%7C%7C50.04%3B0%3B1671.6%3B0%3Bvan%20Dyck%7C%7C%7C79.37%3B0%3B2004.2%3B0%3BMunch&high=)
When we consider the relationship between lifespan and productivity, we find the names of some of the most prolific painters.

The data also reveals lesser-known figures whose work rivals or exceeds that of the "canonical" artists. Three highly productive female painters stand out. 

We conclude our tour of paintings on Wikidata with these three artists.

There are various versions of *Sugaring Off* (1945), a series of paintings depicting the maple syrup harvest in rural New England. She lived to 101, a reminder that productivity and longevity can intersect in unexpected ways.


## Gaps

[](vis/#coverage)
How complete is the data?

Not every painting has information for every property. The gaps reflect both the nature of historical documentation and the ongoing, volunteer-driven process of building Wikidata. 


[](vis/#coverage&col=%23FF00D3&xax=0;100&line=&ann=75.22%3B0%3BCreator%3B0.6%3B69%25&high=69;Creator)
The most reliably recorded property for paintings, is **creator**, closely followed by inception and material.


[](vis/#coverage&col=%23FF00D3&xax=0;100&line=&ann=28.14%3B0%3BMovement%3B0.6%3B22%25&high=22;Movement)
Most paintings do not specify a **movement** directly. For this analysis, we had paintings inherit movements from their creators. Even with this enrichment, movement remains the least documented property.


[](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_sum_of_all_paintings)
The data explored here exists because of an ongoing community effort.
The WikiProject _Sum of All Paintings_ coordinates the work of documenting every notable painting on Wikidata.


[](txt/#allpaintings&annotations=secondary(692,547,153,0,0))
Like Wikidata itself, the project compiles what others have already published, relying on secondary sources from museums, archives, and art historical scholarship.


[](txt/#allpaintings&annotations=secondary(703,416,153,0,0);!0_structured(700,601,51,153,102))
It maintains clear guidelines for how paintings should be described, e.g., which properties to include, how to handle materials, genres, and attributions.


[](txt/#allpaintings&annotations=!0_secondary(781,406,153,0,0);structured(762,602,51,153,102);open(742,247,0,102,153))
And because this is linked open data, anyone is free to query it, visualize it, or build upon it, as we have done here.


[](txt/#allpaintings&annotations=!0_secondary(728,186,153,0,0);open(723,107,0,102,153);structured(727,257,51,153,102);work(730,558,254,97,0))
There is still a lot of work to be done: paintings missing creators, dates, materials, genres, or images. 


[](txt/#allpaintings&annotations=secondary(728,186,153,0,0);open(723,107,0,102,153);structured(727,257,51,153,102);!3_work(725,393,254,97,0);help(730,545,255,176,0))
