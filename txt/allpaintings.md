# Wikidata:WikiProject sum of all paintings

The __WikiProject sum of all paintings__ is a WikiProject to have a Wikidata item for every notable painting.*

### Background

On Wikipedia we have a lot of experience breaking down large amounts of work into smaller chunks that can be completed. Examples of this are the windmill project on the Dutch Wikipedia and the many lists of historic buildings that were created for Wiki Loves Monuments (Q1353202). For paintings we can use the same strategy: We break it down into smaller parts that can be handled and then we can utilize Wikidata to celebrate the sum of all paintings through linked open data!


### Scope

All or everything is too broad and has no limit. This limit is to be able to handle the processing of the data – let's not overwhelm ourselves (yet). The scope can always be expanded – in the future we will have the sum of all sculptures, drawings, you get the picture! The scope of this project is notable paintings. A painting is considered notable if one of these options is true:

*  The painting is in a notable collection of a museum, library, archive (e.g. a painting in the Metropolitan Museum of Art)
*  The painting is made by a notable artist (e.g. Van Gogh painting in a private collection)

__Tips__

* Paintings in scope meet notability guidelines in Wikipedia, as they are notable for being in a notable GLAM (Q1030034) collection, are painted by notable painters, and/or generally have secondary reliable source documentation written about them.
* GLAM is an acronym and means galleries, libraries, archives and museums, but in a broader sense includes also public buildings like castles, town halls, administrative buildings or religious buildings like churches, cloisters, temples etc. that can hold paintings or wallpaintings and other pieces of art.
*  Use the guidelines of item structure when adding data to each painting entry. Think of it like a collections management database of information.
*  If you come across an item (i.e. a painter, medium, collector) that does not exist, please create a new item on Wikidata!

### Work

Getting the data for all paintings and importing this data and curating the items is a lot of work. To make this manageable we subdivide all paintings in smaller sections by collection (P195). This way people can focus on one collection, get it to a certain standard and then move on to another collection. For this to work every painting needs to have collection (P195).

Here are a few ways you can get started in helping out!

Help bring these lists down to zero
Wikidata already has quite a few paintings. You can help by adding missing information to these paintings.

Here are some other lists you can help with:

* Paintings missing creator - Top missing properties by number of sitelinks/P170
* Paintings missing inventory number
* Paintings missing collection - Top missing properties by number of sitelinks/P195
* All paintings without date
* All paintings without material - Top missing properties by number of sitelinks/P186
* All paintings without depicts - Top missing properties by number of sitelinks/P180
* All paintings without genre
* All paintings without image
